Biscts Version 1.1 Change Log:

1.) Created new installer package which will support future upgrades and allow more customization.
2.) Authentication change from the original Active Directory verification to a check of whether the user has the built in Administrator account. This solves the potential vulnerability of storing the user’s password for a short period of time.
3.)   Added more fields to the database tables to match what is current at SDIN. This change is also reflected in all functions of Biscts.
4.)   Implemented the change from “Biscuits” to “Biscts”
5.)   Corrected minor form load issues resulting in previous data staying in the form even after a reload.
6.)   Handled database connection error by adding a test and message box function which will display error to the user.
